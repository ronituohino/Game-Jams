My first Ludum Dare entry ever!

My Friend N, is an attempt at a story-adventure game. A really really short one :monkey_face: The point was to tell a story about a kid, who adventures in his imaginary worlds after losing contact with his father. N (Nothing) is his imaginary friend who travels with.

I encourage to download the game, since WebGL doesn't support Unity VFX. 
Otherwise you're missing out on a pretty cool effect in the end! :D

Controls:

-W, A, S, D to move around and the mouse to look around

(((IMPORTANT)))
-Numberkeys 1, 2 and 3 to answer to dialogue.

-Numberkeys 9 and 0 to decrease / increase mouse sensitivity

-Space to skip the start intro if you don't feel like watching it :P

*Theme clearance*

The theme was "Start with nothing."
In the game your adventure starts with Nothing (your imaginary friend) on your side!
